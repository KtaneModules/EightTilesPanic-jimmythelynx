  description: "Eight Tiles Panic 1.1.1\nThere is an alien invasion going on in the
    neighborhood.\nTo solve the module tap or hold 5 tiles in the correct order, based
    on the chaos in the streets.\n\nThis was originally planned to be released for
    Ktane Modding Jam #1 (Boardgames) but I didn\u2019t got it finished in time. The
    module is based off a small tile-laying game called \u201ENine Tiles Panic\u201C
    which I never played but felt it looked cool.\n\nModule ID: eightTilesPanic\n\nCreated
